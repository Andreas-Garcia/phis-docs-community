## Background

Phis is part of SILEX collaborative meta-project developped at MISTEA joint research unit (INRA - SupAgro).
More information on SILEX is availbale at [SILEX wiki](https://mulcyber.toulouse.inra.fr/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/silex/index.php/Accueil "SILEX wiki Main Page").
The present documentation is a resource material related to the Phis version developped for field phenotyping, which complete name is SILEX-PHIS-FIELD.

Phis is organized around three layers : the layer of the data storage (first layer), which the users do not access directly, but using clients (3rd layer) which interact with the data layer through the web services layer (2nd layer).
