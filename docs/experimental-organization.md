# Experimental Organization

## Projects

### What are projects ?

### What are project properties ?

A project is the higher level of organisation in PHIS.
A single experimentation can include several experiments from various experimental campaigns.
Projects fact sheets are all public, i.e. visible for every PHIS user, including those unrelated to them.
However, experiments and objects included in a project are accessible only to the users defined as owner or guest of this project.

The mandatory fields are :
- acronyme
- name

### Create a project
Within the `Projects` directory, one can create a new project with the
<span class="btn btn-success">Create Project</span> button.

Tool tips are provided for most fields: they appear on the left hand side when one drags the pointer on those fields.
